        <h3>Choosing a piano</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>When it comes to playing any instrument, you can’t start until you have one! There are several choices when it comes to pianos, and some might be more or less expensive than others. Here are three that you can buy to get started in order of least expensive to most expensive.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Digital keyboard
            </li>
            <li>
                Digital piano
            </li> 
            <li>
                Acoustic piano
            </li> 
        </ol>
        <p>Many people opt for a digital keyboard, as they do not have the necessary space or budget to accommodate a full acoustic or digital piano in their home. However, keyboards are not as versatile as a piano, and will likely not feel like one either. Digital pianos can feel and sound closer to a traditional piano while not being as large and expensive as one, so it might be a good compromise if you can afford it.<br>
            
        <br>Another thing to keep in mind is how far you want to take your piano playing. Do you want to learn how to play simple pop chords, or do you want to do something more complicated like learn how to play jazz and classical music? If you don’t plan on <i>seriously</i> investing in your piano playing, an acoustic piano might be overkill. A keyboard would be better suited in that case.</p>
        
        <h3>Skills you need</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>The piano is quite easy to pick up at first. Playing a note is as simple as pressing a key on the piano. However, making music with these keys is a different matter. You’ll need to learn how to use both hands at the same time, which can be tricky at first. Memorization is also key, especially in classical music.<br>
        
        <br>The most important skill any musician needs, however, is persistence. If you get any sort of instrument, and then let it collect dust, you’ll never improve. You won’t make it very far by practicing once in a blue moon, either. Practice whenever you can, every day if possible. Even when the next hurdle seems difficult, you need persistence to continue to push past it.<br>

        <h3>Beginner pieces</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>To practice, however, you need music! Learning how to play a specific piece of music will not only help you learn, but it also gives you a clear goal to work towards. The feeling of being able to successfully play something is quite motivating in and of itself. Therefore, here are a few pieces that might help you get started.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
